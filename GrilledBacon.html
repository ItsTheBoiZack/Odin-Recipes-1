    <img src="Food-Images/1.jpg" alt ="Grilled Bacon Egg and Zuchini Boat">

    <p>2 medium zucchinis (about 1 pound 9 ounces total and/or each about 9 inches long)</p>
    <p>One tablespoon of olive oil</p>
    <p>Kosher Saky and Freshly Grounded Black Peper</p>
    <P> 1/4 cup of extra-sharp shredded cheddar</P>
    <p> 1/4 cup of grated Havarti cheese</p>
    <p> 1/4 cup of finely chopped fresh chives</p>
    <p> 1/4 Cup of heavy cream</p>
    <p>4 large eggs</p>
    <p>1 clove garlic grated</p>
    <p>4 strips of bacon</p>




    <p>Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off the middle burner for 3-burner grills or the 2 middle burners for grills with 4 or more burners and keep the other 2 burners at medium high. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (The grill should be around 400 degrees F. Be sure to consult the grill manufacturers guide for the best results.)</p>
