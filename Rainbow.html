    <h1>"Rainbow Brioche"</h1>

    <img src="Food-Images/Rainbow.jpg" alt ="Rainbow Brioche">

    <p>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour </p>
    <p>1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons sugar</p>
    <P>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</P>
    <p> 1/2 cup whole milk </p>
    <p> 4 large eggs </p>
    <p> 1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature, plus more for the plastic wrap and brushing the bread</p>
    
   



    <p>Place the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low speed to combine. Add the milk and 3 of the eggs and mix on low speed until well combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough starts to pull away from the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <p>Reduce the speed to medium and start adding the butter, a little at a time and waiting until it is completely incorporated to add more, about 5 minutes. Increase the mixer to medium-high and continue to mix until the dough is glossy and slightly tacky but not sticky, about 7 minutes. </p>
