    <h3> “Fillings” </h3>
	
    <p> 1/3 cup strawberry jam </p>
    <p>1/4 cup cornstarch</p>
    <p>1/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
    <P>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</P>
    <p> 2 pounds strawberries, hulled and quartered</p>
    <p> 4 large eggs </p>

   <h3> “Biscuit Toppings” </h3>

   <p> 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour </p>
   <p> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar </p>
   <p> 2 teaspoons baking powder </p>
   <p> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt </p>
   <p> 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced </p>
   <p> 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold heavy cream </p>
   <p> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </p>
   <p> Vanilla ice cream for serving </p>
    
   

    <p>For the filling: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Whisk together the jam, cornstarch, sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons water in a large bowl until well combined. Add the strawberries and toss gently to coat evenly. Transfer the mixture to a 2-quart baking or gratin dish, using a spatula or the back of a large spoon to gently pack the fruit into an even layer. Set aside.</p>

<p>For the topping: Pulse together the flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3/4 cup of the cream and the vanilla and pulse until the dough just starts to come together. Do not over mix.</p>

<p> Spread the dough evenly over the strawberries, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons cream and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. </p>

<p> Place the cobbler on a baking sheet and bake until the topping is lightly browned and the fruit is bubbling, about 1 hour. Let the cobbler cool completely before serving, 2 to 3 hours. Serve with vanilla ice cream. </p>
